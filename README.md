### Artificial Intelligence

Given an image, we use facial recognition to check whether there is a match in a set of images. Our approach is based on the [Eigenfaces algorithm.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenface)

This project is the result of a 48-hour coding competition at McGill University.
